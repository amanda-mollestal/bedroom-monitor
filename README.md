# Bedroom Temperature & Humidity Monitor
This project allows you to monitor and log the temperature and humidity in a bedroom using IoT technologies. 

The code is written in Pyton and runs on an Raspberry Pi Pico W	Microcontroller. 

The project utilizes the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity and communicates the data to the Adafruit IO platform via MQTT.

## Features
Measures and logs temperature and humidity data in real-time

Publishes data to the Adafruit IO platform for easy visualization

Simple and modular code structure for easy understanding and customization

## Prerequisites
Raspberry Pi Pico W	Microcontroller

DHT11 sensor

Breadboard

Jumper wires 40-pin male/male

Wi-Fi network 

Adafruit IO account (for data storage and visualization)
